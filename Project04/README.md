 Python Django Stock Trader App

 Users start with a fake balance of $1,000,000 to use to "buy and sell stock".   The chart shows current activity from the API.  
 Account History page shows a list of your recent activity - stocks bought and sold.  
 Account reset sets everything back to zero and all your money is back.  

This was an interesting app to build.  I learned a lot about django and realized I need to learn more.   I need to be better about CSS.
